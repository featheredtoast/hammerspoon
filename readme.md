This is my hammerspoon config, mostly to replace spectacle. There are also some extra shortcuts to make life good.

It also adds some bindings to move windows across to other screens. shift-ctrl-meta-alt arrows to move current window left/right.

shift-ctrl-meta-alt m to move *all* windows to the currently focused screen.
